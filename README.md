In this repository you will find introduction to unit tests training. From provided material you will learn:
- what unit tests are,
- how to develop them correctly,
- how you can cooperate in project to build better unit tests,
- how unit tests work.

Go to the second part of training: [Unit tests II coding](https://github.com/ObjectivityBSS/Trainings.UnitTests.ProgrammingBasics)

This training has been prepared especially for testers but I believe that other groups will find also useful information.
